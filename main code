20 Magical Python Tricks To Write Better Code


Trick 1: Multiple Assignment for variables""")

print("""
Condition I - Values equal to Variables

When the variables and values of multiple assignments are equal, each value will be stored in all the variables.

a, b = 10, 20
print(a, b)

Output:
""")

a, b = 10, 20
print(a, b)

#print()

print("__"*20)

print("""
Condition II - Values greater than Variables

Let us try to increase the number of values in the previous program. The multiple values can be assigned to a single variable. While assigning more than one value to a variable we must use an asterisk before the variable name.

a, *b = 10, 20, 30
print(a)
print(b)

Output:
""")

a, *b = 10, 20, 30
print(a)
print(b)

print("""
The first value will be assigned to the first variable. The second variable will take a collection of values from the given values. This will create a list type object.""")

print("""
Condition III - One Value to Multiple Variables

We can assign a value to more than one variable. Each variable will be separated using an equal to symbol.

a = b = c = 10

Output:
""")

a = b = c = 10

Trick 02 - Swapping Two Variables

Swapping is the process of exchanging the values of two variables with each other. This can be useful in many operations in computer science. Here, I have written two major methods used by the programmer to swap the values as well as the optimal solution."""

"""
Method I - Using a temporary variable

This method uses a temporary variable to store some data. The following code is written with temporary variable name.

a , b = 50 , 60
print(a,b)
temp = a+b
b = a
a = temp-b
print()
print("After swapping:",a,b)

Output:
""")

a , b = 50 , 60
print(a,b)
temp = a+b
b = a
a = temp-b

print("""
Method II - Without using a temporary variable
The following code swaps the variable without using a temporary variable.

a , b = 50 , 60
print(a,b)
a = a+b
b = a-b
a = a-b
print()
print("After swapping:",a,b)

print("""
Method III - Optimal Solution in Python

This is a different approach to swap variables using python. In the previous section, we have learned about multiple assignments. We can use the concept of swapping.

a , b = 50 , 60
print(a,b)
a , b = b , a
print()
print("After swapping",a,b)

Output:
""")

a , b = 50 , 60

a , b = b , a

Trick 03 - Reversing a String

There is an another cool trick for reversing a string in python. The concept used for reversing a string is called string slicing. Any string can be reversed using the symbol [::-1] after the variable name.

string = "PYTHON"
rev_string = string[::-1]
print(rev_string)

Output:
""")

string = "PYTHON"
rev_string = string[::-1]
print(rev_string)

Trick 04 - Joining Two strings

Joining is a method which is used to join two or more strings. This can be done by various methods""")

print("__"*20)

print("""
Method-I: Using Addition Operator

Joining various strings can be done just using the addition operator (+).

a = "I Love "
b = "Python"
print(a+b)

Output:
""")

a = "I Love "
b = "Python"
print(a+b)

Method-II: Using join function

Joining various strings can be done just using the join function. It is more fast and better way to join two or more strings.

a = "I Love"
b = "Python"
joined_strings = " ".join([a, b])
print(joined_strings)

Output:
""")

a = "I Love"
b = "Python"
joined_strings = " ".join([a, b])

print("""
Trick 05 - More than one Conditional Operators

Two combine two or more conditional operators in a program we can use the logical operators. But the same result can be obtained by chaining the operators. For example, if we need to do print something when a variable has the value greater than 10 and less than 20, the code will be something like the following.

a = 15
if (a>10 and a<20):
   print("Hi")

Instead of this we can combine the conditional operator into single expression.

a = 15
if (10 < a < 20):
   print("Hi")

Output:
""")

a = 15
if (10 < a < 20):
   print("Hi")

print("""
Trick 06 - Find most frequent element in a list

The element which occurs most of the time in a list then it will be the most frequent element in the list. The following snippet will help you to get the most frequent element from a list.

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 1, 3, 8, 3]
most_frequent = max(set(my_list),key=my_list.count)
print(most_frequent)

Output:

most_frequent = max(set(my_list),key=my_list.count)
print(most_frequent)

print("__"*20)

print("""
Trick 07 - Find Occurrence of all elements in list

The previous code will give the most frequent value. If we need to know the occurrence of all the unique element in a list, then we can go for the collection module. The collections is a wonderful module in python which gives great features. The Counter method gives a dictionary with the element and occurrence pair.

from collections import Counter

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 1, 3, 8, 3]
print(Counter(my_list))

Output:

from collections import Counter

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 1, 3, 8, 3]

Trick 08 - Checking for Anagram of Two strings

Two strings are anagrams if one string is made up of the characters in the other string. We can use the same Counter method from the collections module.

from collections import Counter

string_1 = "HEART"
string_2 = "EARTH"

if(Counter(string_1) == Counter(string_2)):
   print("Anagram")
else:
   print("Not Anagram")

Trick 09 - Create Number Sequence with range

The function range() is useful for creating a sequence of numbers. It can be useful in many code snippets. The syntax for a range function is written here.

Syntax: range(start, end, step)

Let us try to create a list of even numbers.

lst = list(range(2,20,2))
print(lst)

Output:

lst = list(range(2,20,2))

Trick 10 - Convert Mutable into Immutable

The function frozenset() is used to convert mutable iterable into immutable object. Using this we can freeze an object from changing its value.

try:
   lst = [1,2,3,4,5]
   lst = frozenset(lst)
   lst[3]=7
   print(lst)
except TypeError:
   print("frozenset object does not support item assignment")

Output:

Trick 11 - Merging Two Dictionaries in Python

In python, we can merge two dictionaries without any specific method. Below code is an example for merging two dictionaries.

dict_1 = {'One':1, 'Two':2}
dict_2 = {'Two':2, 'Three':3}
dictionary = {**dict_1, **dict_2}
print(dictionary)

Trick 12 - Getting size of an object

The memory size varies based on the type of object. We can get the memory of an object using getsizeof() function from the sys module.

import sys

x = 5
print(sys.getsizeof(x))

Output:
""")

import sys

x = 5
print(sys.getsizeof(x))

Trick 13 - Combining two lists into a dictionary

The zip unction has many advantages in python. Using zip function we can create a dictionary from two lists.

dictionary = dict(zip(list_1, list_2))
print(dictionary)

Output:

Trick 17 - Rounding off with Floor and Ceil

Floor and Ceil are mathematical functions can be used on floating numbers. 

•The floor function returns an integer smaller than the floating value.

•The ceil function returns the integer greater than the floating value. 

To use this functions we have to import math module.

import math

num = 18.7
print(math.floor(num))
print(math.ceil(num))

Trick 18 - Using Conditions in Ternary Operator

In most of the time, we use nested conditional structures in Python. Instead of using nested structure, a single line can be replaced with the help of ternary operator. The syntax is given below.

age = 25

print("Eligible") if age > 20 else print("Not Eligible")

   y = x**2
   square_list.append(y)
